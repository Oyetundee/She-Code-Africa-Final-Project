The dataset provided contain information on different vehicles. It’s expected to determine the price of the vehicles by analysing all the info provided in the dataset. It’s obvious that a car’s price is purely determinants on its present state, value of its part, and other parameters. All these parameters are available on the dataset and with adequate analysis, using powerful data analytic techniques, the price will be estimated. 
It is well known in the “World of Data” that most datasets are not perfect from its source. It always comes with a lot of issues, discrepancies, inconsistencies, and errors that must be checked. This always happens because of how the data is collected or the fault of those inputting them. This vehicle dataset is as such. There are a lot of “Not a Value” fields, confusing inputs, inconsistent values, etc. This is where data cleaning and wrangling comes to play. 
Cleaning of the data will be done carefully to ensure a pure and adequate dataset that will work best for providing a positive outcome. In this notebook, I will be showing the processes, techniques, and tools I have in my disposal for working on the datasets.
